Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The reasons for selecting the project were explained well.

The project was introduced well. I suggest you practice the demo in
preparing for the second interview, to make sure it goes smoothly and
looks more professional.

As we have discussed, there are details missing in the software
process. I would be happy to replace this part of the interview grade
with what you achieve in the second interview.
