__10_ / 10  (5 marks per issue) DETAILED issue descriptions for both issues considered, including UML diagrams, code traces, etc.

__8_ / 10  Report on reasons for selecting the issue to implement, including

_2__ / 5 A complete and comprehensive acceptance test suite for the selected issue.

Expect details for each criterias (ie. what a user/developer should do to achieve a query/use the api? what do you mean by privileged clients? etc.)

__7_ / 10  Architecture document. Now that we know more about architecture, we expect a more informed analysis. Among other aspects, the following should be discussed:
-- architectural style; architectural pattern if applicable
-- description of all components
-- description of interfaces between components

-- discussion of cohesion of components
-- how are each of the following addressed with architectural choices (if applicable)
   -- performance
   -- security
   -- safety
   -- availability
   -- maintainability


Should be more concreate about coupling/cohesion, maintainability, interface segregation, etc., instead of just listing the techniques the Spring framework provided.
