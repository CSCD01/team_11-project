28/40

Overall architecture: __7_ / 15

   __2_ / 5 It is clear to the reader that the team correctly
           understands the architecture of the project.


   __2_ / 5 A reader, initially unfamiliar with the architecture of the
           project, has a good overview of the project structure after
           reading the report.

   __3_ / 5 UML diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful.

The report don't provide enough information about the business logic is structured in OpenMRS and how they interact with each other. From the report, it seems that the team messed up MVC's model and OpenMRS custom module.


Software Process: _11__ / 15

   __6_ / 7 Every aspect of the software process is explained to an adequate
           level of detail.

   __5_ / 8 There is a thorough explanation of why this particular
           process works for this particular team. The arguments for
           the choice of the process and any modifications are
           well-informed and well explained. The pros and cons of
           different processes are carefully considered.
